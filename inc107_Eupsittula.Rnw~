\subsection{Genus Eupsittula, species \emph{Eupsittula pertinax}}

The genus Eupsittula contains one widespread and common species.

\emph{\Sexpr{k}} is widely distributed in Venezuela, and  was expected in \Sexpr{ sum(subset(mexp,spp %in% k)$freq)} sampling points.

Available data allowed to fit several alternative models, and models with both climatic and vegetation covariates received most support according to AIC weights.

There seems to be a slight effect of the hour of the day on the probability of detection for this species.

However, the best supported model includes a constant $p$.

The following map shows the predicted (unconditional) probability of presence for the whole country based on the model with highest support and the values of the vegetation and climatic covariates.
